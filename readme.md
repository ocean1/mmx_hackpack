# Megaman Xtreme/2 gb/c hack pack

This repo contains a vwf implementation for Megaman Xtreme, and
a graphics/maps decompressor/recompressor for Megaman Xtreme 2.

# Disclaimer
Code is awful, these are maybe the first two C programs I've ever written long time ago (2005/2006)!
I didn't check, but they should be still working.
